# Overview
FirnLearn is an Antarctic steady-state firn densification model based on data science.Firn density models are simulated using a deep artificial neural network (i.e. deep learning). Other models have also been built using Lasso (a product of the elastic net regularized multiple linear regression), random forest (i.e. ensemble decision trees regression), and gradient boosting (i.e. random forest with boosting). FirnLearn has been trained on a dataset of firn density observations (montgomery et al. 2018) and RACMO (Van Wessem et al., 2014; Noel et al., 2018).

FirnLearn is built upon widely used Python libraries (Keras, Scikit-learn and Statsmodels).
